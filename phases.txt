PHASE 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

Initialize Next.js 16 project

npx create-next-app@latest hrms --ts
cd hrms


Install core dependencies

npm install tailwindcss shadcn-ui prisma @prisma/client better-auth react-query zod pusher-js


Setup Tailwind & Shadcn

npx tailwindcss init -p
# Configure shadcn
npx shadcn-ui init


Setup Prisma + Neon

Add DATABASE_URL in .env

Add full schema (from final schema) to prisma/schema.prisma

Run migration:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init_hrms
npx prisma generate

Multi-level approval workflow:

Manager → HR → Admin

PHASE 12: Reports & Dashboards

Employee overview

Attendance summary

Leave summary & balances

Payroll summary

Asset allocation report

Notifications history



PHASE 13: Security & Roles

Role-based route protection (Admin/HR/Employee)

Session management via BetterAuth

Validate permissions for:

CRUD actions

Approvals

Asset assignment



PHASE 14: Testing

Unit tests for core modules (Prisma + APIs)

Integration tests for flows:

Leave request → approval → notification → payroll update

Attendance with geo-fencing & shift logic

Manual QA for dashboard UI



PHASE 15: Deployment

Vercel for Next.js frontend + server actions

Prisma migrations on Neon production DB

Environment variables:

DATABASE_URL

PUSHER keys

BetterAuth secrets

Setup cron jobs for:

Document expiry reminders

Auto-clean notifications

Leave accrual resets



PHASE 16: Optional Enhancements

Email/SMS notifications

Payslip PDF storage & download

Approval escalation if manager absent

Audit logs for compliance

Remote employees (ignore geo-fencing)

💡 Tip for Implementation

Start module by module (Employee → Attendance → Leave → Overtime → Payroll → Assets → Notifications).

Use server actions + Prisma transactions for multi-step processes like approvals + payroll calculations.

Use React Query for client data fetching + optimistic updates.

Use Shadcn components for forms, tables, modals, and dashboards.
